# REPLOCATE branding

## Key Colors
The REPLOCATE logo is developed in the sRGB
color space. These hex values should match it
identically in most web browsers.

	Text and border:     #5A5972
	Blue field (flag):   #6D82ED
	Red stripe (flag):   #FF676C
	Background:          #FFF1E7

## Typography
Font: Share Tech (Google Fonts)
[not a good body font btw, ok for headers]
The logo text should always appear underneath the
"flag map" icon, not next to it. Variants without
the text are fine for certain contexts.

## Logo Spacing
Vertical space above and below the positive space
of the logo should be equal in size to the width
of the letters "REPL" in the logo, demonstrated in
the uncropped samples.
Horizontal spaces before and after the positive space
should be equal to the letters "REPLO" in the logo.

## Background Color
The REPLOCATE logo should be displayed on a light
background, either on the given orange-tint background, 
or pure white. It should not be part of a title bar that
is its own distinct color, but sit on top of the
dominant color of the page. The logo should not be
inverted, as it represents the colors of the US flag
in a specific pastel color palette.

## App Icon/Favicon
As a small square icon, the logo should be used without
the text, with ample spacing. There are size variants
with varying border thickness supplied. These icons
should invariably use the given background color.

The given icon sizes correspond to a logical size
(not physical size) at which each icon should be used.
The large icon should be used at sizes at or below 
its 1x size, etc. (see display density)

Large:   372px
Medium:  128px
Small:   64px
XSmall:  32px

## Display density
Proper CSS rules etc. should be used to make sure the
logo does not appear blurry — if using raster (PNG)
versions of the logo, the proper variant @1x, @2x, @3x
should be used in accordance with the display DPI.
The logical pixel size (CSS px) should not exceed
the file size divided by the dots-per-pixel (1/2/3).
Prefer the SVG in settings where it can be used.
